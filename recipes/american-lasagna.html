    <h1>Homemade lasagna</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch 
        tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna 
        filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of 
        small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
        I have found none better anywhere Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
